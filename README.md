![Cat goes outside](images/logo.png)

- This is a 2d game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM.
- Complete "vanilla" Javascript with no Canvas or no libraries added, game coded from scratch.
- Implemented complete game logic and UI, including start screen, game screen, and end-game screen.
- Using classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to organize data, functionality, and game elements.
- Using `setInterval()` to create a game loop that continuously updates the game elements.
- Handle user input and events to control game elements.
- Randomly generated obstacles (positive and negative) add complexity and challenge to the game.
- Obstacles generated randomly and in random time interval, increasing the level of player.

Background:

- Use arrows to move player
- Avoid hitting the obstacles on the ground
